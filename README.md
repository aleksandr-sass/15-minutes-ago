# 15-minutes-ago
15-minutes-ago CLI-app

This is my first JS-app.

If you want to try it out:

1) Download and install NodeJS on your computer;
2) Download ZIP-file with my code;
3) Unpack the ZIP archive to any folder you wish;
4) Then go to file "input.txt" and edit it, if you want (comment: this file is a ready sample; edit file "input.txt" to change the output);
5) Then open that folder in command line (Windows) or in Linux-terminal (using a command "cd", for example: "cd C:\node\15-minutes-ago" (for Windows) or "cd /node/15-minutes-ago"  (for Linux);
6) Type "node app.js" and press ENTER button on your keyboard;
7) Then go to "output.txt" file. There you will see the results.

Now you know all about this app.

Good luck in testing:-)
